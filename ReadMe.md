# ⚙️ Approval Flow

The workflow follows a structured **approval hierarchy**.

Employee → Department Head → Manager → CEO → Completed

### Process Overview

👤 **Employee**
Submits workflow request

⬇

🏢 **Department Head**
First level approval

⬇

👔 **Manager**
Second level approval

⬇

👑 **CEO**
Final approval

⬇

✅ **Workflow Completed**

---

# ⚡ Smart Routing (Dynamic Skipping)

The system automatically skips unnecessary approval levels depending on who starts the workflow.

Example rules:

* If a **Manager starts the workflow**, the **Department Head step is skipped**.
* If the **CEO starts the workflow**, it **automatically completes**.

This ensures **faster processing and minimal delays**.
